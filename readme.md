## IntelliDrive
IntelliDrive is an application and service combo that is used to bring the power of "smart" cars to basic cars without the need for a whole new car.

The barrier to entry for a smart car can be described in one word: <b>cost.</b> 

Money is the biggest reason people can't upgrade to a car with smart capabilities. The cost is just too high. However, as of a couple of years ago, more than 50% of Americans owned a smartphone, the FCC and Germany declared Internet a utility. Smartphone and Internet use has never been higher, and modern smartphones have more than enough power to make a car <i>smart.</i>

What we've done with IntelliDrive is to bring many of the powerful features of smart cars to regular cars with smartphones, and somne features that are not availabe in regular cars too!

Try out IntelliDrive today! It's free, open source, and let's be honest here, it's really cool.
